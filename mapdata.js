We visited the Devonian Gardens at the mall downtown, and also went to a Western clothing store where you found me my grey Kes-coded dress. :) Then at the end of our roadtrip, we stayed at the same apartment on 6th & 10th (not even intentionally!!) where we confessed our feelings, cuddled and kissed. Then we had a beautiful night watching the sunset at the Peace Bridge. Oh, and the next day we went to the cat cafe, and then the zoo to see my penguin friends. And we also saw hippo toes up close.

The end bit had an aerial hoop and a cyr wheel (my fave!!)",

The second cruise that we did had a super fancy 3-course meal as well. It was prawn bisque, then steak with potato pavé, and a mango panna cotta for dessert. It felt so fancy.
